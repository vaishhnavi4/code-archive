public class RemoveDuplicates {

/*
 * Removing Duplicates from a String
 * This problem involves taking an input string and producing a new string where
 * all duplicate characters are removed, typically preserving the original order
 * of first occurrences. For example, given the string "programming", the output
 * should be "progamin" because duplicates like the second 'r', 'm', etc., are
 * eliminated. This is useful in scenarios like data cleaning or generating
 * unique character sets.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: "hello world"
 * Output: "helo wrd" (removes duplicate 'l', 'o' in "hello", and spaces are
 * treated as characters; if spaces should be ignored, the logic can be
 * adjusted)
